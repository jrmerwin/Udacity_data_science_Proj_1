## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You should be able to run the code in the .ipynb file here using the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run using Python versions 3.*.

## Inspiration<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I was interestested in exploring an Olypmic athlete data set from Kaggle user Stack Overflow data from 1980 to better understand:

1. How does country team size influence the number of medals won?
2. Are there any significant differences between male and female athletes?
3. How do the characteristics of Olympic athletes change over time?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one Jupyter notebook available here which runs the analysis of the dataset. Some additional information is provided in the Markdown cells.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of this analysis can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
